## Introduction to Git and GitHub

Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes in their code. GitHub is a platform built around Git that provides hosting for software development and collaboration. With GitHub, you can manage projects, track issues, and collaborate with other developers on shared repositories.

## Getting Started

### Installing Git

Before using GitHub, you need to have Git installed on your machine. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system:

- **Windows**: Download the installer from the [Git website](https://git-scm.com/) and follow the setup instructions.
- **macOS**: Use Homebrew by running `brew install git` in your terminal.
- **Linux**: Install via your package manager, e.g., `sudo apt install git` for Ubuntu.

### Setting Up Git

Once installed, configure your Git environment by setting your username and email:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
